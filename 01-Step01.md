## Step 1 - Adding a Controller

Let's go ahead and add a new Controller using Copilot!

1. Select the `Controllers` folder in your Solution Explorer and then hit Ctrl+Shift+A
2. In the dialog box name the file `StoreController.cs`
3. In the C# file that loads you can use a prompt similar to the one shown to add the three methods (Index, Browse, Details) you need. Enter the prompt as a comment then hit enter.

    ```csharp
    namespace CopilotMvcMusicStore.Controllers
    {
        public class StoreController
        {
            // add three methods named Index Browse Details
        }
    }
    ```

What happens? Did you get three methods generated? 

Go ahead and re-run the project and then manually enter the URL suffixes of /store, /store/browse and /store/detail to see the result of this generated code.

Did Copilot recommend any additional methods? If so, would they have been useful?

Additional steps to perform:
- Use Copilot to make sure you have a Constructor which take one argument of an `ILogger`. There should be a private property in the class as well that the constructor assigns to.

- Make sure your StoreController inherits from Controller. You can make this change manually. Your class definition should look like this:

    ```csharp
    public class StoreController : Controller
    ```
